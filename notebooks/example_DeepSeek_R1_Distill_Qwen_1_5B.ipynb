There's another point G not on the line, and we're given several distances: AC is 26, BD is 22, CE is 31, DF is 33, AF is 73, CG is 40, and DG is 30. I need to find the area of triangle BGE. Hmm, okay, let me try to visualize this.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, since all the points are on a straight line, I can imagine them arranged in the order A, B, C, D, E, F. So, from left to right, we have A, then B, then C, then D, then E, then F. Point G is somewhere off the line. So, triangle BGE is formed by points B, G, and E.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think the first step is to figure out the positions of each point on the line. Maybe I can assign coordinates to each point to make it easier. Let me set a coordinate system where the line is the x-axis. Let's let point A be at coordinate 0. Then, since the points are in order A, B, C, D, E, F, I can assign coordinates to B, C, D, E, F as some increasing values.\n",

      "\n",
      "Wait, but I also know that AF is 73. Since A is at 0 and F is at x + 112, AF is the distance from A to F, which should be x + 112 - 0 = x + 112. But AF is given as 73, so that gives me the equation:\n",

So D is at some coordinate, and D - (-39) = BD = 22. So D is at -39 + 22 = -17. Wait, that would mean C is at 26, D is at -17, which is to the left of C. But the order is A, B, C, D, E, F, so D should be after C. Hmm, that doesn't make sense. There's a contradiction here.\n",
